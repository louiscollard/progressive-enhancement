            <h2>The story</h2>
            <p> 
                Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,<q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q><strong> Maybe.</strong></q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,<q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>The farmer again said,<q><strong>Maybe.</strong></q>
            
                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too <p class="bad">bad</p></q> and the farmer responded,<q><strong>Maybe.</strong></q>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,<q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said,<q><strong>Maybe.</strong></q>
                
                The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <p class="good">good</p> or <p class="bad">bad</p> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <p class="good">good</p> fortune.</br>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                <p class="good">Good</p> and <p class="bad">Bad</p> are just one perspective. Bananas are <p class="good">good</p> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <p class="good">good</p> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
